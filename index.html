      <p>
        Hi, I’m a computer science student who likes building things, taking them apart, and learning how they work.
        I mainly code in C++ and Typescript. Outside of class, I’m into reverse engineering and I’m very active
        with boxing.

        This site has three pages: this homepage, a resume, and a topic page that dives into a few of my interests.
