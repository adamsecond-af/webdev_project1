      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m a computer science student who likes building things, taking them apart, and learning how they work.
        I mainly code in C++ and Typescript. Outside of class, I’m into reverse engineering and I’m very active
        with boxing.

        This site has three pages: this homepage, a resume, and a topic page that dives into a few of my interests.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Boxing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Boxing helps me stay consistent, manage stress, and keep a routine.</li>
          <li>I've realized I need a routine to keep my mental health up which is either with boxing or the gym.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
