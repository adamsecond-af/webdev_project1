        <h2>Why I Like to Travel</h2>
        <p>
          Traveling helps me reset and gives me a new perspective. I like exploring places that feel different from
          home, trying new food, and learning how people live day to day. Even short trips feel meaningful when I
          come back with new memories and ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like travel because it pushes me to be present. Whether it is walking through a new neighborhood
          or finding a viewpoint at the end of a long day, it makes me slow down and actually notice details.
