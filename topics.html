        <h2>Why I Like to Travel</h2>
        <p>
          Traveling helps me reset and gives me a new perspective. I like exploring places that feel different from
          home, trying new food, and learning how people live day to day. Even short trips feel meaningful when I
          come back with new memories and ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like travel because it pushes me to be present. Whether it is walking through a new neighborhood
          or finding a viewpoint at the end of a long day, it makes me slow down and actually notice details.

        <h2>Architecture is What I Notice First</h2>
        <p>
          Architecture is one of the main reasons I get excited to visit new places. I like seeing how buildings are
          designed, and history of the area. Sometimes the most interesting parts are the small details like textures, courtyards, and patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy comparing older structures to modern buildings and noticing how materials and shapes change over time.
          I also like places where you can walk around and see a mix of styles in just one area.
